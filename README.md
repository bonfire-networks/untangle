# Untangle

Logging/inspecting data, and timing functions, with code location information.

## Logging/inspecting
`Untangle` provides alternatives for `IO.inspect` and the macros in Elixir's `Logger` to output code location information. It also provides a polyfill for `dbg` which was introduce in Elixir 1.14

The first argument is `inspect`ed and the second argument (if provided) is used as a label:

```
iex(1)> import Untangle
Untangle
iex(2)> debug(:no, "the answer is") # log at debug
11:19:09.915 [debug] [iex:2] the answer is: :no
:no
iex(3)> dump(%{a: :map}, "it") # inspect something on stdout
[iex:3] it: %{a: :map}
%{a: :map}
```

When used in a code file, the location information becomes more useful, e.g.:

```
[lib/test_untangle.ex:15@Test.Untangle.example/2] Here's an empty list: []
```

You may also notice from the iex output that it returns its first argument. This makes it ideal for inserting into a pipeline for debugging purposes:

```elixir
do_something()
|> debug("output of do_something/0")
```

When you are done debugging something, the location of the debug statement is already in the output so you know where to remove it, comment it out, or simply change `warn` or `info` for `debug` if you only need it during development :-)

## Timing functions
You can decorate functions to measure and log their execution time:

```
use Untangle

@decorate time()
def fun(), do: :stuff
```

will output something like `[info] Time to run MyModule.fun/0: 1 ms`

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `untangle` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:untangle, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

# Configure as default `dbg/2` handler

## In config/config.exs
`config :elixir, :dbg_callback, {Untangle, :custom_dbg, []}`
